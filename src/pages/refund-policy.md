At GitFolders, we want you to have a great experience using our service. This Refund Policy explains how we handle payments and refunds.

By subscribing to GitFolders, you agree to the terms outlined below.

## 1. 10-Day Free Trial

All new users are eligible for a **10-day free trial**. During this period, you can use GitFolders with full access to all features at no cost.
You will only be charged once the trial period ends and you continue using the service.

We encourage all users to evaluate the product during the trial to determine if it fits their needs.

## 2. No Refunds After Subscription Starts

Once your free trial ends and your subscription begins, **all payments are final and non-refundable**.

We do **not** offer partial refunds, prorated refunds, or refunds for:

- Accidental purchases
- Lack of usage or dissatisfaction after the trial

## 3. Exceptional Circumstances

Refunds may be granted **only in rare, exceptional cases** at our sole discretion â€” for example:

If you believe you are eligible for a refund under such circumstances, please email us at [support@gitfolders.xyz](mailto:support@gitfolders.xyz) within **7 days** of the charge.
